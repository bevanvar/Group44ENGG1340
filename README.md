## GROUP 44 - ENGG1340
This is the readme file for Group 44's (of ENGG1340 - Computer Programming 2) repository. The group members are Bevan Varghese and Katyayani Singh.

### Problem Statement 
Management of stock is as important an aspect of a company's functioning as any other. "Supply and demand" is a phrase closely associated with the performance of a brand in the market - without supply, there would be no demand. Our program aims to optimize the process of managing supply, with the help of a **commodity inventory system**. We aim to build the system such that it allows staff to keep a track of commodity inventory in the company's retail outlets, and efficiently carry out tasks to ensure the smooth running of delivery and sales. 
This program will be built in C++, in a stage-wise fashion. We expect to complete the project by 27th April, 2019. 

### Problem Setting
_What our program does?_ Sets up a commodity inventory system for stock management.  
_Whom does it help?_ The inventory management chain of a business on the large scale, all the way down to small family businesses.  
_Why is it helpful?_ Optimises and ensures management of inventory in an efficient manner.  
Since the repository will be open to the public, anyone can get started with this system when the need arises (after the program has been fully developed, of course).

### Program Features
#### Required Features
1) Search for commodities with different filters  
2) Insert new commodities with basic information  
3) Delete obsolete commodities  
4) Update commodity information  
5) Automatic updation of inventory status based on availability  
6) Alerts when commodity is out-of-stock
#### Additional Features
1) Monitoring of expiry dates of commodities, if any, and alerts for the same  

We aim to complete the **required features** and add any **additional features** that seem feasible as we go about developing our program's code.
