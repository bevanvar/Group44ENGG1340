## GROUP 44 - ENGG1340
This is the readme file for Group 44's (of ENGG1340 - Computer Programming 2) repository. The group members are Bevan Varghese and Katyayani Singh.

### Problem Statement 
Management of stock is as important an aspect of a company's functioning as any other. "Supply and demand" is a phrase closely associated with the performance of a brand in the market - without supply, there would be no demand. Our program aims to optimize the process of managing supply, with the help of a **commodity inventory system**. We aim to build the system such that it allows staff to keep a track of commodity inventory in the company's retail outlets, and efficiently carry out tasks to ensure the smooth running of delivery and sales. 
The program has been built in C++.

### Problem Setting
_What our program does?_ Sets up a commodity inventory system for stock management.  
_Whom does it help?_ The inventory management chain of a business on the large scale, all the way down to small family businesses.  
_Why is it helpful?_ Optimises and ensures management of inventory in an efficient manner.  
Since the repository will be open to the public, anyone can get started with this system when the need arises (after the program has been fully developed, of course).
#### Reasonable Assumptions
All data entered must be case-sensitive.


### Program Features
#### Required Features
1) Insert new com1modities with basic information  
2) Update commodity information  
3) Delete obsolete commodities  
4) Search for commodities with different filters
   - serial number
   - commodity name
   - manufacturer name
   - stock status
5) Automatic updation of inventory status based on availability  
6) Scan the inventory to check if any commodity 
   - is out of stock
   - nearly out of stock
#### Additional Features 
1) Displays the whole inventory in order of serial number along with the number of commodities.
2) Displays the whole inventory in order of demand (popularity based on number of sales) along with the number of commodities. 
3) Imports an existing inventory from a .txt file named after the shop.
4) Writes the updated inventory to a .txt file named after the shop.
